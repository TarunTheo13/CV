I am a creative and technical thinker, with a strong multidisciplinary background, who loves taking left-field approaches to problem solving.

Recent achievements include setting up a fortnightly podcast featuring speakers from the US and Europe, creating a murder-mystery web game in under two weeks for our final project and ongoing volunteering to cook for people struggling with homelessness.

I am excited to work in tech as I thrive in an environment that offers constant learning and growth, as well as the opportunity to work for a company contributing towards a better future.
